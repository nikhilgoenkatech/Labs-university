### Where to find the new metrics

So, now that we have installed our extension, we want to see it working.

To do that, you have to go to **Hosts** and select the one or one of the hosts. Then, select the process that is submitting data, e.g. **MongoDB**.

![mongo-process](../../assets/images/mongo-process.png)

Now, there is a tab called **MongoDB metrics**, or however you named it in the `plugin.json`

![keycharts-group](../../assets/images/keycharts-group.png)

![mongo-tab](../../assets/images/metrics-tab.png)

If you click on this tab, there are you custom metrics that your extension gathered:

![custom-metrics](../../assets/images/custom-metrics.png)
