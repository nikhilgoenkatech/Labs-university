## Session Objectives

This lab focuses on ingesting metrics through Telegraf agent. For demo purpose, we used an SNMP agent simulator to simulate a SNMP metric to be captured by Telegraf agent and then ingesting that SNMP metric to Dynatrace.

* Installing the OneAgent on the host
* Configuring Telegraf
* Running SNMP agent simulator
* Finding Telegraf metrics in Dynatrace
* Visualise new Telegraf metrics in Dynatrace
* Reading new SNMP metric in Dynatrace
* Setting up custom alerts on SNMP metric
* Triggering an alert to see how Davis AI reads, populates baseline for the SNMP metric
